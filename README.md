What is here?
This is my little instruction (and just practicing) of how I work with Git not using command line for those who doesn't like it as much as I do.
___
Git Desktop + VS Code
Very nice combo IMO.
First of all we work with VS Code.
1. We create folder with our future project.
2. We can add some files in it (Like I do RN).
3. Find on left side of VSC "Source control" button or just press CRTL+SHIFT+G.
4. If it is new local project - it will say that You dont have repository yet.
5. Pressing Initialize Repository will do all job! Let's "Commit" some changes we just got with message "Initialize". And then we press "Publish Branch" to make some magic.
6. If you did not yet, it will ask you to log in into your Git account. Very easy. Just log in using Git or select your name of list if you did that before.
7. Press publish again, and set name of your Repository. Select it as public or private as you want.
8. Random stuff
9. Update incoming.
